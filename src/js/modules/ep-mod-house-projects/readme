WORKFLOW
I. User driven workflows

1. User changes filter adjustments :

1.1.  Filter Model View orders its Model to change settings
1.2.  Filter Model changes its 'set_values' and triggers 'changeFilter' on self
1.3.  Filters Collection, listening to Filter Model event 'changeFilter',
      triggers 'requestFilteredEstimate'
1.4.  Projects Collection, listening to Filters Collection
      'requestFilteredEstimate', invokes Filters Collection method
      'setFilteredEstimate' with a set of filtered projects
1.5.  Filters Collection updates number of filtered projects and triggers on
      itself 'changeFilteredEstimate'
1.6.  Filters View, listening to 'changeFilteredEstimate', updates estimate
      number of filtered projects on its 'submit' button


2. User clicks 'submit' :

2.1.  Filters View orders its Collection to apply filters.
2.2.  Filters Collection triggers 'applyFilters' on self.
2.3.  Projects Collection, listening to 'applyFilters', filters self ( resets
      with a set of filtered projects ).
2.4.  Projects View, listening to 'reset' of its Collection, renders changed
      Collection.


3. User clicks 'reset' :

3.1.  Filters View orders its Collection to reset filters.
3.2.  Filters Collection orders each of its models to reset itself (3.3.), then
      triggers 'resetFilters' on self (3.4.)

3.3.1.   Filter Models reset their 'state_values' and trigger 'resetFilter' on
         themselves.
3.3.2.   Filter Views, listening to 'change' event on their Models, re render
         themselves.

3.4.1.   Projects Collection, listening to 'resetFilters' on Filters Collection,
         resets self with '_full_collection_models' ( stored copy of all the
         Models )
3.4.2.   Projects View, listening to 'reset' of its Collection, renders changed
         Collection.
